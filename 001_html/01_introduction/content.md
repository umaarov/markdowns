# Introduction to HTML

## Part 1: History and Origin of HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created in the early 1990s. It was developed by Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN. The first version of HTML was released in 1993.

Initially, HTML was designed as a simple way to structure scientific documents. It quickly evolved to support more features as the web grew in popularity. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was formed in 1994 to standardize HTML.

HTML 2.0 was the first standard specification of HTML, published in 1995. HTML 3.2 followed in 1997, adding many new features including tables and support for stylesheets.

The major breakthrough came with HTML 4.01 in 1999, which is still widely used today. After HTML 4, development split into two paths: XHTML and HTML5.

## Part 2: What Can Be Done with HTML

HTML is the backbone of any website. It provides the basic structure of a page using a system of elements and tags.

With HTML, you can create:
- Text content with various headings, paragraphs, and formatting
- Links to other pages or resources
- Images and multimedia content
- Forms for user input
- Lists, tables, and structured data

HTML works with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling. This separation allows for better maintainability and design flexibility. JavaScript adds interactivity to static HTML pages.

Modern web development relies heavily on HTML5, which introduced semantic elements. These elements give meaning to the structure of content (like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`).

HTML5 also added support for audio and video without requiring plugins. Canvas elements enable dynamic, scriptable rendering of graphics.

## Part 3: Getting Started with HTML

Creating an HTML document is simple. You only need a text editor and a web browser.

A basic HTML document structure looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML document.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Save this code with a `.html` extension. Open it in any web browser to see the result.

The most important HTML tags to learn first include:
- `<html>`: The root element
- `<head>`: Contains meta information
- `<title>`: Sets the page title
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Heading elements
- `<p>`: Paragraph elements
- `<a>`: Link elements
- `<img>`: Image elements

HTML is easy to learn but takes practice to master. The best way to learn is by building your own web pages from scratch.
